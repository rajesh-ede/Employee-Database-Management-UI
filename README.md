# 🏎️ F1 Drivers Database Management

A modern **Frontend Machine Coding Round Project** — reimagined as an **F1 Drivers Database Management System** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** ⚡

Originally designed as an *Employee Database Manager*, this version is customized to manage and display data for **Formula 1 drivers** — including their profile photo, team, salary, and more.  
It’s an excellent showcase of dynamic UI rendering, data handling, and event-driven DOM manipulation — key skills tested in frontend interviews.

- Displays driver list dynamically in the UI.
- Highlights selected driver.

### 👤 Driver Information Panel
- Displays detailed profile on selection:  
  Name, Age, Email, Country, Team, ID, DOB, and Salary.
- Includes professional profile image for each driver.

### ➕ Add Driver
- Add new drivers dynamically with validation.
- Updates the list and renders new data instantly.

### ❌ Delete Driver
- Remove a driver from the list dynamically.
- Re-renders UI after deletion.

## 💡 Key Interview Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| DOM Manipulation | Dynamically creating and updating UI elements |
| Event Handling | Managing user interactions like click and submit |
| State Management | Tracking selected driver and re-rendering UI |
| JSON Data Handling | Fetching and parsing structured data |
| Input Validation | Handling invalid or missing input gracefully |
| Reusability | Transforming existing logic for new use cases |

## 🧠 Why This Project Stands Out

Most frontend machine coding interviews test how well you can:
- Manage **real-time DOM updates**  
- Handle **data fetching and events**  
- Keep code **clean, modular, and readable**

This project demonstrates all of those using plain JavaScript — no frameworks, no shortcuts.
